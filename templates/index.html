            <h1>Desdemona in Othello</h1>
            <section class="article-subsection">
                <h2>Intent</h2>
                <section class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        In reading <i>Othello</i>, the tragedy of Desdemona affected me deeply.
                        She was a strong and caring woman who advocated ceaselessly for others 
                        and herself, yet was killed after Othello's jealousy sent him into a
                        violent rage.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        The narrative of Desdemona as a silent victim or a "weak female character"
                        is reductive and unfair. I made this website to analyze Desdemona's character in 
                        <i>Othello</i> in as many angles as possible, through the lens of art and life, 
                        as a woman who had a strong life and voice up until the very end.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        This kind of misconstruing of character matters because when stories about violence
                        against women are perceived in a way that blames women for not being strong or proactive enough,
                        it creates a dangerous narrative that affects the way that society perceives real victims of gender
                        based violence.
